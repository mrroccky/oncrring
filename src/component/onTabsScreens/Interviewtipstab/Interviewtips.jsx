						<h5>Make a good impression at a job interview, with advice on how to prepare, and how to show what you have to offer.</h5>
						<h5>Prepare
							Choose a date and time that works for you so you can be ready for the interview and be at your best on the day.

							To help make sure you‚Äôre prepared:

							read the job description and person specification carefully. Be clear on the skills and qualities the employer is looking for
							check the company website to find out more about its products or services and their plans for the future
							go over your CV or application form and think about things the employer may ask you about
							prepare some examples that show you have the right skills, personal qualities and experience. Use the STAR method
							practise your timings on presentations and keep a back-up copy
							ask someone you trust to help you practise answering questions
							think of 2 or 3 questions of your own that you can ask at the end of your interview, to show you‚Äôre enthusiastic about the job
							pick out something suitable and comfortable to wear
							check what time you need to arrive and the name of the person you need to see
							make sure that you know how to get to where the interview is being held. Work out your public transport route or where you can park. Plan to arrive 5 to 10 minutes before the interview starts
							make sure you know who to call in case you‚Äôre late for any reason
							If you have a disability you may need adjustments to make the interview accessible. You can get advice from Scope on how to ask for adjustments at an interview.</h5>

					<div><h5>Types of interview</h5>
						There are different types of interviews which employers might use. You should prepare for the one you‚Äôre attending.
						<h5></h5>
						<h5>One-to-one interview</h5>

						<h5></h5>
						Your interview may only be with one person. This is usually face-to-face, and is more common in smaller companies.
						<h5>
							Panel interview</h5>
						Some interviews are with a panel of 2 or more people. Make sure you look at all the interviewers when you‚Äôre speaking with them. They may also ask you to do a presentation.

						Group discussion
						A group discussion is usually part of an assessment centre day with other candidates. You'll have to show you can get along with people, put your ideas forward and be respectful of others.</div>
